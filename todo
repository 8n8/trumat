The current target is to correctly indent top level bind bodies.

- the only valid expression is 0
- the only valid name is x
- the module declaration should be "module X exposing (x)"
- there should be exactly two empty lines between each bind
- there should be no trailing spaces
- there should be one trailing newline
- there should be a single newline after the equals sign
- there should be a single space after the name
- binds cannot have parameters

The file should contain:

- the module declaration
- just one top level bind
- no comments
- no type signatures
- no type declarations
- no imports

It only needs to run on Ubuntu Linux x86_64.

It must not change any formatted Elm file. This is important because it means it can be used as it is without causing any harm.
