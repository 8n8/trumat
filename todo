The current target is to format list expressions.

This excludes list expressions in code blocks in doc comments.

Everything else should be left unchanged as much as possible. Of course there will have to be some changes, for example this code:

[ a, b
, c
]

will change to

[ a
, b
, c
]

So the b and c are moved around.

Currently formatted code must not be changed.

It only has to work on Linux x86_64.
