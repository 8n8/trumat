Please follow one of these steps so I can see if I can reproduce code generation issues locally:

1. Is your API public-facing? If so, please share the link to your GraphQL endpoint.
   or
2. You can send me your schema.json. Just execute [the introspection `gql` query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/master/docs/introspection-query.gql) and send me the result.
